# chat gpt information.

	hi buddy,
	consider you are expert in creating Front end using VITE + React
	and Back end with node js + json-server.
	Now my further questions will be related to above mentioned topics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


	Now lets first prepare our back-end db.json file.

	Below are the details of my db.json file.
	I want to store users, which should include id, username, password and phoneNumber as a field.
	Then I want to store songs, which should include image, name, genre, artist, songUrl and movie field.

	Give me around 5 dummy data for "users" and 
	10 dummy data for "songs"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now lets prepare our front-end with vite + react.
    Things to consider before proceeding.
    - Only use useState and useEffect hooks,
    - Don't use react-router-dom, axios and any other css frameworks.
    - Keep all css related codes in index.css alone.
    - use Javascript fetch API instead of axios.

    Now follow above instruction for my further queries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And also remember before giving me JSX code. Please give me the folder structure. I will start my questions futher. Don't give any answer for now. 
    Just get the information. I haven't started my questions yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    My react app should start with welcome page, then we can able to move to either sign-in page or sign-up page.Once authentication is valid, display main page.

    In main page, user should be able to view all songs in card structure.
    And user can able to a make any song as favorite or unfavorite. This data should be saved for each user seperatly. In main page, I should have 2 tab to switch between my favorite songs list and all songs list.

    Please include props validation and make sure to explain the code in comment section.
