Client:
 A device or software application that requests services or resources from a server. Clients can range from personal computers, smartphones, tablets, to specialized hardware devices.
Server:
 A device or software application that provides services or resources to clients. Servers are typically high-powered computers optimized for processing requests from multiple clients simultaneously.

Request:
 A message sent by a client to a server, typically asking for access to a specific resource or service. Requests can take various forms, such as HTTP requests in web applications.
 HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
  used to transfer HTML pages over network

Response:
 A message sent by a server to a client in reply to a request. Responses contain the requested data or indicate the outcome of the request (e.g., success, error).

Protocol:
 A set of rules and conventions that govern communication between clients and servers. Common protocols used in client-server architecture include

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

Statelessness:
 In many client-server architectures, servers do not maintain information about the state of client sessions between requests. Each request from a client must contain all the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request. This simplifies server design and scalability but may require additional mechanisms for managing user sessions.

Database:
 A structured set of data stored and organized to support the operations, storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data.

SQL database
 They are table and row oriented. They Use SQL (structured query language) for shaping and manipulating data, which is very powerful. SQL database
 example:
  oracle
  mysql
  microsoft sql server
  sqlite
  Postgre sql
NoSQL database
  mongo db ( stored as document )
  couch db ( stored as document )
  firebase ( stored as document )
  graphQL  ( stored as graphs )
  neo4j    ( stored as graphs )

API:
 API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
 API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention.

RESTful API:
 An architectural style for designing networked applications, based on HTTP and the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer).
Server-Side Frameworks:
 Pre-written, standardized code that developers can use to streamline the development process, such as Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), or Express.js (JavaScript), spring boot ( java )

Authentication:
 The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
Authorization:
 The process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.
