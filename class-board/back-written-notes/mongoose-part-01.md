# Mongoose

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database and Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution.
- The Mongoose acts as the abstraction layer over the MongoDB database.
- It is generally preferred over using normal MongoDB because it simplifies the process of sending complex queries.

## Why Learn Mongoose?

- Mongoose is used in Node application to interact with MongoDB without write complex queries.
- It acts as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) used to define schema model and provides easy communication between application and database.

### Mongoose Advantages

- Schema Definition:
  - Mongoose allows you to define structured schema model for MongoDB collections,
  - because of that you get a clear understanding about the structure of model data.
- Data Validation:
  - It can be used for data validation,
  - which ensures that only valid and properly formatted data is stored in the database,
  - which helps to manage data integrity.
- Middleware Support:
  - Mongoose has the support of middleware which helps in the execution of custom logic before or after database operations,
  - that offers flexibility in handling data interactions.
Query Building:
  - We donâ€™t have to write those complex queries which we were writing in MongoDB because -
  - Mongoose simplifies the process by providing a high-level API that makes it easier to interact with the database.
- Modeling Relationships and Population:
  - You can define relationships between different data models and it also supports population,
  - due to this you can work with related data without disturbing database normalization.
